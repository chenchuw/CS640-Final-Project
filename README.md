### Project: Demographic Age (<21 and >=21) and Race (black, white, Hispanic/Latino, Asian) prediction of Twitter users

Our team uses trained two models with two different datasets to predict users’ age and race. There were twitter users’ profile information (user id, first name, last name, location, language, race, age, etc), profile pictures and tweets in the two given datasets. We mainly focus on text models in this project.
